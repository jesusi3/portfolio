            <p className='AboutMe-2'>I’m Jesus Sanchez, a 1st Generation Mexican American, who’s persistent personality pushed him to where he is now. Previously a Frontline supervisor at UPS, which brought upon transferable skills such as quick decision-making and great communication/Listening skills. With 2 years worth of experience, I brought those skills with me to aid me in completing web development and solutions tasks, and to continue learning from others as I go on. As I transfer to becoming a software engineer, I plan to use the skills that I learned in GA’s SEI program to push me further in the tech world to becoming a well-rounded engineer.</p>
